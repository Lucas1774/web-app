Correct any typos and adjust the sentiment annotations to match each specific asset. \n- If a news for \"AMD\" is marked \"positive\" but the text clearly implies a negative impact for AMD, and a positive impact for other company, switch it to \"negative\", and vice-versa.\n- Do not remove any news items or switch any sentiment to \"neutral.\"\n- Leave unrelated \"positive\"/\"negative\" tags and everything else unchanged.\n- Fix any non-UTF-8 character sequences.\n\n 2. After youâ€™ve cleaned the input, use that cleaned version to run your financial analysis.\n\n{placeholder}"
