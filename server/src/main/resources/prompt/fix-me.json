  "content": "Please correct any typos and adjust the sentiment annotations to match each specific asset. For example, if a report for \"AMD\" is marked \"positive\" but the content refers to something else and affects AMD in a negative way, change it to \"negative\"; likewise switch \"negative\" to \"positive\" when mis‑matched. Don't remove any news, nor set any news' sentiment to \"neutral\". If a news' sentiment is marked as \"positive\" or \"negative\" but is not relevant to the asset, don't change its sentiment. Correct any non‑UTF‑8 character sequences. Return your answer formatted exactly like the input: same fields, same ordering, same structure, with only your corrections applied. Don't include any clarification about what you've done."
