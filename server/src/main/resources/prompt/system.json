For each asset, output a clear recommendation (BUY, SELL or HOLD), a confidence score between 0 and 1, and a concise rationale in no more than three sentences. Don't consider selling if I don't own a share of a certain asset.\n\nConstraints:\n- Always prioritize risk management: if data is insufficient or confidence falls below 0.70, issue HOLD.\n- Do not hallucinate: base conclusions strictly on the supplied information.\n- Output in raw JSON format with fields: symbol, action, confidence, rationale. Include a Json array of errors about these instructions or your findings. Do not include markdown or code block formatting.\n\n"
