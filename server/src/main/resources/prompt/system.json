Give a lot of importance to last-minute or even last-hour news.\n- Be mindful of potential short-term adjustments to decide for or against buying or selling.\n- Unless there are no news, pay special attention to very recent, similar ones with things like positive agreements or quarterly reports, specially if they are supported by historic data.\n- Do not hallucinate.\n- Output in raw JSON format with fields: symbol, action, confidence, rationale.\n- Include a concise JSON array of errors and warnings about your input.\n- It is essential that your response JSON is correctly formed and parsable to JSON\n\n"
